			%p Time is precious and after a long working week the desire to head over for some calm relaxation in a stunning property is more than tempting.  However, airline timetables or commuting from mainstream terminals can often make this dream an unpleasant reality.

			%p For some of our more discerning clients we offer a private jet service which runs an exclusive shuttle to your chosen destination.   However, recognising the budgetary restraints we offer a 12 seater plane which runs every Friday to Nice and returns before Breakfast on Monday. 

			%p Nice is our most popular destination and where BlackDog was launched, our properties in the Cote Dâ€™Azur are amongst the finest we own.  Guests are able to share the Private Jet and thus take advantage of a discounted rate.  

			%p Luggage restrictions apply.
